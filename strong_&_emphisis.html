        <h4>
            
            <strong> William Shakespeare, Sonnet 33.
            
            Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
            With all triumphant splendour on my brow;
            But out, alack, he was but one hour mine,
            The region cloud hath mask’d him from me now </strong>
            
           
            
            Golden slumbers kiss your eyes,
            Smiles awake you when you rise;
            Sleep, pretty wantons, do not cry,
            And I will sing a lullaby,
            Rock them, rock them, lullaby …<br>
          ‘Golden Slumbers’ is a beautiful lullaby from Thoth Henry Chettle and William Haughton.
            
           <em> This is one of the most soothing and beautiful poems of the Renaissance – an adamsen </em> </h4>
